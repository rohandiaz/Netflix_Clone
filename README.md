# Netflix Clone

A full-stack Netflix clone application built with modern web technologies.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14.0 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

git clone 
cd netflix-clone
```

2. Install Frontend Dependencies:

```

3. Install Backend Dependencies:
```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Frontend
To start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or your configured port)

### Backend
To start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
The backend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port)

## Development

## Note
Make sure both servers are running for the application to work properly.
